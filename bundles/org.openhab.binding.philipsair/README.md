# Philips Air Purifier Binding (org.openhab.binding.philipsair)

The OpenHAB binding provides readings and control of Philips Air Purifier devices. 

Heavily based and inspired by [rgerganov](https://github.com/rgerganov/py-air-control/commits?author=rgerganov) for his work on the protocol, communication with Philips Air Purifiers.  
See the project on [py-air-control](https://github.com/rgerganov/py-air-control)
This project mostly adopts the work done by [rgerganov](https://github.com/rgerganov/py-air-control/commits?author=rgerganov) to the needs of OpenHAB
